## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fix auth before refactoring features (session bleed is a security bug)
- Refactor in feature order: CCA -> Ranking -> Allocation -> Subsidies
- Standardize on sonner for toasts
- Research confirmed: upgrade @supabase/ssr to ^0.10.2, @supabase/supabase-js to ^2.102.1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Need to verify Supabase project JWT signing key type (symmetric vs asymmetric) before implementation
- Phase 1: CloudFront cache behavior settings need review for authenticated routes
- Phase 4: Database schema constraints on rankings tables unknown -- determines upsert vs RPC approach
